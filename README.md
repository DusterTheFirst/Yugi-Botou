# Yugi Botou
A Discord bot for playing ridiculous custom Yu Gi Oh cards with friends and other people  
Use the command y.help to get the command list

### Self-hosting
Self-hosting the bot is totally possible. You will need to create a `config.json` file that has 2 fields.  
The first one, `token`, should be pretty self-explanatory
The second one, `owners`, is an array of Snowflake IDs. It can be as big as you want.
